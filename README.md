### Advanced NLP with 🤗 Transformers
1. **Transformers** 🤗  
   - A cutting-edge library for natural language processing tasks.  
   - Includes pre-trained transformer models like RoBERTa, BERT, and more.  
   - Simplifies NLP workflows with pipelines for tasks like sentiment analysis.  

   Installation:  
   ```bash
   pip install transformers

### Transformers Library 🤗
1. **RoBERTa Model** 📚  
   - **RoBERTa** (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) is a transformer-based model tailored for language understanding tasks.  
   - It delivers high accuracy and robustness for sentiment analysis tasks.  

2. **Pipeline** 🚀  
   - The `pipeline` API simplifies using transformer models for various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and text classification.  

   Example usage in the notebook:  

   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline

   # Load pre-trained sentiment-analysis pipeline
   sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="roberta-base")

# Example Visualizations
